            <p>I was building my WordPress website and found it limited in the styles that I could implicate. I knew what I wanted it to look like, but found it difficult to manipulate the template. My blog is still hosted on WordPress as it has many fantastic features, like the simplicity of loading a post and managing it from my phone.</p>
            <p>In true “Gemma” curiosity, I wondered if I had the capability to build my own site and put my ideas out into the world. You don’t get anywhere without trying, so I started my journey to build this very website.</p>
            <p>One of the most important things I have learnt since starting this is version control. With using Git, GitHub and Visual Studio Code combined; I have come a long way since creating multiple folders in my drives and labelling v1, v2 and so on.</p>
            <p>Take a look around my site and feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to know more about my journey!</p>
