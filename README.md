A personal website practicing coding techniques

Hi, I am new to coding HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I am in the process of building a website to develop my skills and learn techniques.

I'd love for ideas on how to make this more efficient. Please explain the process and the reasons why things need to be changed, if you think something I have done can be improved. I would like things to be explained.

THINGS TO DO:

1) Having trouble with javascript the pop up modals. I have used ID but need to use CLASS so I can make multiple pop-ups with different recipes on. Any ideas how I can do this?
2) Adding in a menu button which once clicked pulls out of the right hand side.

Thank you,
Gemma
